What is Money for Blood?
================================================================================================================
================================================================================================================

Money for Blood is a browser-based Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game which is currently in development 
powered by the CodeIgniter Framework by EllisLabs. The MFB application is coded by a 21 year old web developer 
named Paul Chater whos website(s) can be found at:

When will Money For Blood be finished and will it be free?
================================================================================================================
================================================================================================================

I currently have no set date on when MFB will be finished, although i'm planning on pushing out a Private 
Alpha around Mid to Late November 2010

Yes, of course MFB will be free. The only thing that we would be charging for may be donations, but that will 
not be a required commitment. Small donations will be going into a personal fund which pays for the server to run 
MFB. 



What is the MFB Policy?
================================================================================================================
================================================================================================================

The MFB Code is not allowed to be used on LIVE servers although it can be downloaded and run on a local host 
to learn from. MFB isn't currently an Open Source Application, although admittedly that is a bit hypocritical 
considering that it is on a Public Git Repository (this will be changed Friday 31st July 2009.)

If you are planning to run MFB on a local host to learn from then you must contact Paul Chater immediately 
via either msn messenger, email or by a direct message on twitter. Contact details are below.
